# The Gallery Page



## Description

The app is a gallery page that displays pictures with their descriptions and allows visitors to like them. The main problem that the app addresses is how to build a reusable gallery component in React using componentization. This is achieved by breaking down the gallery into three separate components - App, GalleryList, and GalleryItem, each with a specific responsibility and functionality. 

The App component is responsible for rendering the overall application, while the GalleryList component represents the gallery of images. The GalleryItem component represents a single image in the gallery with the ability to toggle between the image and description and like an image. 

this app provides a practical way of building a reusable gallery component in React using props to pass values between components. By breaking down the gallery into smaller components, the app demonstrates how to make the code more manageable and maintainable.
